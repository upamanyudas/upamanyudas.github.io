<p>We have been debating too long about technology being a boon or a curse. Well according to me (and this is my strictly personal opinion) it is a bigger curse than it is a boon.</p>

<p>It has and is slowly taking humanity to a more anti-social level. It is making us lesser and lesser connected to each other by souls.</p>

<p>My analysis is that, technology was great, till a certain extent. But then it got out of bounds, breaking the leash. The methods of delivery of information started becoming more and more dangerous.</p>

<p>Today it has reach an extent, where we cannot survive without technology. I find this notion frightening.</p>

<p>In frame are my cousins, Srijit (brother) &amp; Srija (sister).</p>
