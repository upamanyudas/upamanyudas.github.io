</header>

<p>I'm a wildlife photographer, filmmaker, naturalist and explorer dedicated to documenting wildlife and the environmental issues that define our times. I freelance with many magazines, environmental NGOs and production houses.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, I have worked on many wildlife photography and filming projects. My work has appeared in many publications worldwide.</p>

<p>In my previous life as a Designer, I co-founded a design consultancy, which I very dearly named <a href="http://studio.upamanyu.in/" target="_blank">Cloudstudio</a>. Though that is a company I'm still attached with, I now have started to give most of my time to mother nature, and my very dear business partner, takes care of the day-to-day management of the company.</p>

<p>Sharing my knowledge of photography, wildlife, and people across various platforms including workshops and seminars is an important part of the work I do. I collaborate with wildlife scientists, conservationists, policy makers, activists and educators on conservation action, activism, documentation, books and film projects.</p>

<p>I hope to combine an artist’s eye with a journalist’s curiosity and sense of storytelling in my visual style, resulting in a body of work I hope will inspire the viewer to discover more. Using narrative and visual construction I strive to lure the audience into the subject, prompting them to ask questions rather than accept a ‘standard version’ of changing landscapes.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">Pronunciation</h3>
</header>

Pronuncing my name can be a little difficult. The approximate phonetic is /uːpɔːmʌnjuː daːʃ/.
<p><em>Upamanyu</em> is a sequence of:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>U</b> as in <i>coo</i> without the initial c</li>
<li><b>pa</b> as in <i>paw</i></li>
<li><b>man</b> as in <i>munch</i> without the the final ch</li>
<li><b>u</b> as in <i>you</i> in totality</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Das</b> is like <i>pass</i>, if you replace the pa with D</p>
