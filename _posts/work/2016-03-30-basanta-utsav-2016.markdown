This year, during _Basanta Utsav_ I visited my cousins in Shantiniketan. It was a fun time. I got to experience and photograph one of the most lively celebrations of the festival _Holi_.

The first day of the trip started with attending the rehearsals of the programme, _Chitrangada_.

The second day was that of _Basanta Bandana_, the salutation of spring. On this day, _Viswa Bharati_ presented, an Esraj choir and _Basanta Raas_. Both were magnificent to watch

And the third and the final day was of _Basanta Utsav_. In the morning was a programme, which I wasn't allowed to shoot, and in the evening was _Chitrangada_.
