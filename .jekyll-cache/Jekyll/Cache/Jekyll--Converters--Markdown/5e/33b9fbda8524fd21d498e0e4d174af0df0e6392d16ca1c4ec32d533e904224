<p>This post was longtime due. 2015 and 2016 has been two extremely disastrous years. 2015 with the death of my father &amp; 2016 with my motherâ€™s death. But among the deaths, I am still amused to see so much life around. Life amazes me. Hereâ€™s one of my experiences with a different kind of life &amp; nature.</p>

<p>I have always liked Bombay. One of the reason might be because I grew up there. But, only recently, I realised, how much more there is to Maharashta, than I could have ever seen if I would have stayed in Bombay. Hence, when I shaifted temporarily to Kolkata, I was one of the very few, who had some property back in Bombay. And I must tell you what a peace it was. One would get a primary idea about my love for Bombay and its rains by reading <a href="http://kalam.upamanyu.in/writings/rains/">Post No. 1</a> and <a href="http://kalam.upamanyu.in/writings/washed-away-2/">Post No. 2</a>.</p>

<p>So in the monsoons this year, in the month of May I decided to head over to Purushwadi, a mere 200KM drive from Mumbai. I had heard from the locals about the spectacular view one gets to experience if one heads to the village of Purushwadi. I was quick to ask for support from Carl Zeiss, and they wer quick to reply. This was definitely going to be a trip where I would want to photograph, hence this measure.</p>

<p>The guys at Carl Zeiss were kind enough to sponser few lenses for testing, and with the people from <a href="http://www.grassroutes.co.in/">Grassroutes Journeys</a>, I began the trip.</p>

<p>If you have a look at the photographs, you would understand that I was not very successfull at capturing the fireflies in general, but the landscapes I traversed through, was really worth the experience.</p>

<p>The western ghats is a really beautiful place. And the semi-tribal village stay, with village food, not cellular networks and living in tents, was a experience worth remembering.</p>
