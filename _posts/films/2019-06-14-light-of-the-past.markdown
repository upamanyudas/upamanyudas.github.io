Cave art has mesmerized us ever since a young girl discovered the beautiful cave art in Altamira. But in the past few years, the cave art-viewing experience has been affected due to the washed-out bright white LED lights!

This short documentary features archeologist Leslie Van Gelder and physicist Harald Schwefel and their unique collaboration. Out of their collaboration, emerges a LED light source that promises to shine new light on the viewing of cave art.
