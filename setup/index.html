SETUP & EQUIPMENT
-------
<span class="section-subtitle">Things that I use. Last updated on 7th September, 2017</span>

I am frequently asked about my setup, the hardware and software I use for my work, or what kind of equipment one should choose. Since I don't always have the opportunity to give an answer as precise as I would like, I thought a page describing the setup I am using could be a good idea.
