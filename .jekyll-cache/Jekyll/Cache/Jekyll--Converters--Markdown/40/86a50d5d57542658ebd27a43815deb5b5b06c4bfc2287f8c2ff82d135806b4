I"_<p>A tour in the African savanna has left me spellbound. Such is the beauty of the place. With the vast plains and countless species of mammals and birds, the place is a paradise for a wildlife photographer. In this post are my amateur attempts at capturing some of the mammals and bird species of Masai Mara.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve recently started to photograph mother nature, and Africa is almost a mecca to the fellow photographers.</p>

<p>A few months into this newfound hobby, as my love for mother nature was slowly growing, I was presented with the opportunity to visit Masai Mara to take some photographs. I was more than delighted and snuggled into the team happily.</p>

<p>The stay in Masai was at a 3 star property called Sentrim. Both the lodging and boarding aspects of the property were up to the mark. Though we did not require fans or Air Conditions, but I cannot help but wonder the situation in the Summers. The rooms did not have any method of artificial cooling :)</p>

<p>We stayed a total of four days at Masai, and had full day safaris on all the four days. We covered the reserve pretty well. Though not in totality.</p>
