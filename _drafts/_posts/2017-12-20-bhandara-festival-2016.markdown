There are quite a few traditions around India hold enough strength to amaze you. This curious tradition that goes on around in a small town in Maharashtra, would surely capture your imagination. The town is known as Jejuri and it is situated at about a 50km drive from Pune. I first heard the name Jejuri while sifting through the newspaper one day, where I found a small article on the curious tradition that goes on there.

Quite a few months passed by as I waited for the right opportunity to visit Jejuri. The window to photograph the event was very short and specific. Though regular and daily rituals are carried out at the abode of Lord Khandoba (_Avātār of Shiva_), there is something special about Somawati amavashyas (no moon day that falls on monday).

Finding this once-a-year opportunity in the month of July 2016, I took out my car and started a drive towards Jejuri from Pune. Before I come to the details about the event, I must begin by showing some photographs of the general landscape that was with me throughout.

The absolute beauty of the Western Ghats, never cease to amaze me, and I couldn't help myself but to stop for a few photographs.

Also very intrinsic is the beauty of rural Maharashtra. Being child of Bengal, I've alsways grown up with the open fields and lush greenery around me. Even in my [home at Mumbai](http://kalam.upamanyu.in/writings/washed-away-2/){:target="_blank"}, I was always surrounded my so much greenery. Reading about the droughts and famines in rural Maharashtra, I was always of the biased opinion that the scenery was not quite beautiful. It was only during this drive into the heart of Maharashtra, did I finally break out of my bias.

After a drive of almost an hour, I was finally able to park my car and start my journey into the temple. And from the very entrance, I could see signs of the event I was here to witness.

_Sonyachi Jejuri_ - as the holy town Jejuri is called aptly by the native Maharashtrians, which means “The Golden Jejuri”, comes alive when one looks from the roof top of the Khandoba temple at the porch, at the stairs, at the roads, at the entire Jejuri city and at the people around it when they gather here in myriads during the sacred day of Somawati Amavashya (no moon day that falls on Monday) to pay their reverence to their family god Khandoba. And they do so by throwing around _bhandara_ (turmeric powder) on each other. Almost making it a festival very similar to holi.

Lord Khandoba, is probably one of the most versatile and widely acknowledged god being worshipped across many regions, religions, casts and communities. He is the most popular Kul Devata (family god) among one of the oldest shepherd tribe “Dhangar” and the patron deity of Deshastha Brahmin. People from other communities like warriors, farming and herding castes too keep their high regards towards him. The cult of Khandoba has prominent linkages with Vaishnava and Jain traditions despite him being worshipped as _Martanda Bhairava_, a form of Lord Shiva.

In the temple of Jejuri, surprisingly both the deities of him and his wife Malsha is in the form of _Lingas_ (one of Lord Shiva’s most known statue form) which are covered with decorated silver masks. A part of the Muslims too consider him as their god Mallu Khan and been seen offering goat flesh in the temple areas. This way people consider him as one of the rare non-vegetarian Indian god. Surya and Kartikeya Skanda are his other depictions too.

The offering of turmeric powder to paint the city golden yellow has its many reasons, logics and traditions. Popular belief is that the tradition came from the yore old great Indian tradition of applying turmeric to the bride and groom as an antiseptic agent to protect their immunities. And as the festival is to celebrate the wedding ritual of Lord Khandoba and his wife Malsha, that same ritual has manifested here.

Some also believe it to be the offering respect for his being from the Surya - the symbol of power and brightness. Many paintings depict him riding a horse with a bowl full of turmeric powder in the hand may serve the reason of the amber golden celebration.
