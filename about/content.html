<p>Hello, I’m Upamanyu! I'm a passionate wildlife lover and storyteller. Currently working as a freelance wildlife photographer & film-maker . I have to travel between many places to explore and film nature & wildlife, but if there is one place I call home, that is Kolkata.</p>
<p>I also co-own a design firm from my previos life as a designer that I had very dearly named, <a href="http://studio.upamanyu.in">Cloudstudio</a> which I started in 2008.</p>
<p>I am a storyteller by heart, but I also take immense interest in exploring the deep relations and mysteries of the natural world. While filming nature, being in the natural environment, puts me in my element and I feel completely blessed by mother nature's bounty.</p>
<p>Apart from my passion of Wildlife, I also am interested in technology & design. I used to design and code a lot and still do during the few projects I take up.</p>
<p>If you want to know about the equipment I use head on to <a href="/setup">/setup</a>.</p>
<p>All my wildlife images can be found at <a href="/photography">/photography</a> under the wildlife section. And also at the YouTube channel of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCViBwsOJfQRkVjmKuYLgjqA" target="_blank">The Wild Bits</a>.</p>
<p>Also there is a list of personal &amp; commercial design projects I worked on, at  <a href="/projects">/projects</a>.</p>
<p>I push most of my code to <a href="http://github.com/upamanyudas">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I've also build a few open-source projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://upass.in/2">uPass</a>, a smart password manager for smart people</li>
</ul>
<p>I was born in Kolkata, India, I grew up there. Bengali is my mother tongue but I do have full professional proficiency in English. I speak, read, and understand conversational Hindi.</p>
<p><strong>Pronunciation</strong> : Pronuncing my name can be a little difficult. The approximate phonetic is /uːpɔːmʌnjuː daːʃ/.</p>
<p><em>Upamanyu</em> is a sequence of:</p>
<ul>
<li>U as in coo without the initial c</li>
<li>pa as in paw</li>
<li>man as in munch without the the final ch</li>
<li>u as in you in totality</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Das</em> is like pass, if you replace the pa with D</p>
<p>Though I am not much of a athelete nor am I very sporty (which you will know at once when you meet me), but I do enjoy the one sport, that seems to give me a immense peace of mind. Swimming.</p>
<p>I read &amp; follow <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">HackerNews</a>.</p>
<p>The only sports event I am interested in watching, is the <a href="http://www.olympic.org/">Olympics</a>.</p>
