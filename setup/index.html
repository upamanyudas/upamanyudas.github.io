SETUP & EQUIPMENT
-------
<span class="section-subtitle">Things that I use. Last updated on 3rd June, 2020</span>

I am frequently asked about my setup, the hardware and software I use for my work, or what kind of equipment one should choose. Since I don't always have the opportunity to give an answer as precise as I would like, I thought a page describing the setup I am using could be a good idea. Listed here are the Hardware, Cameraware, Software and Paintware that I use.
