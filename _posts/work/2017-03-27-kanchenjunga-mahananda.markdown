After much deliberation, I decided to go on my first birding tour with the awsome folks at [GoingWild](http://goingwild.in/). I was accompanied by my brother in the trip. For a first time birder, I would consider this to be a successfull trip. We spotted 120 species in total, and were able to click shots of about 100.

The journey started from Jalpaiguri, where we picked up the third member of our group. We then proceeded onwards to Yuksom, where we stayed at Mr. Liboo's comfortable homestay. Birding in and around Yuksom followed. We spotted some very colourful birds, and since this was my first time, every bird we found amazed me. We tried to track the Yellow-rumped Honeyguide, but was unsuccessful.

Next day, we were determined to track the Yellow-rumped Honeyguide, and we got some pretty shots.

Next we proceeded towards Mahananda, briefly coming back to Siliguri. There too, we had an awesome birding ecperience, and spotted a Rofous-necked Horbill couple.

P.S. This is a ongoing series, new pictures will be uploaded regularly.
