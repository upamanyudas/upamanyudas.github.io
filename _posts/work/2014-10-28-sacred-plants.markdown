Recently I have been quite obsessed with typography, and I rediscovered the joy of creating hand-drawn types. This is the first time I am publishing a TYPE.

This type was developed during the summer of 2012. I found it while reorganising my old Dropbox account files.

Redrawn and Vectorised. Enjoy.
