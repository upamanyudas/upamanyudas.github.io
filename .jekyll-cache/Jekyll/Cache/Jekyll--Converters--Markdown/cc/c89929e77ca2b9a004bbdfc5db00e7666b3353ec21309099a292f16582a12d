<p>Bengalis, by birth, are travel-freaks. I too, being a Bengali, am quite fond of travelling to places. There are places all over world, that I dream to travel to. But alas, the dreams remain only dreams most of the time.</p>

<p>The chief problem being the lack of funds and then thereâ€™s also the factor with the timings and all. Whenever I see my friends travelling to any hill station or to the mountain valleys, I always urge to travel with them. But ultimately Iâ€™m stopped due to one problem or the other. I sometimes get jealous of my friends, posting those beautiful sunset photos on Facebook, and I, sitting in front of the computer, working my ass of for the clients.</p>

<p>Amongst all these problems, thereâ€™s one thing that is constant. I never forget to dream. It is almost like, dreaming is in my veins. Even when Iâ€™m unable to travel to my favorite destinations, I dream, dream &amp; dream.</p>

<p>Dreaming also gives me exclusive access to some adventures, that might not be possible to do in the real life. I can dive in the deepest of the oceans, and jump off the highest cliffs in my dreams. Iâ€™ve even dove to the Mariana trench in my dreams. Iâ€™ve swum with the Great White sharks in the deepest of the oceans in my dreams.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve traversed the greatest distance with the Bisons, Gazelles and Zebras in search of food and water during their great migration. Iâ€™ve also been a predator, and hunted them to meet my carnal requirements. Iâ€™ve been the dolphins and helped the fishermen to catch fish, and in turn gotten my own food as reward from them. Iâ€™ve also been the cormorants, assisting the Chinese fishermen catch fish, even though I have to bear the pain in my neck.</p>

<p>In my dreams, Iâ€™ve been the whales in the mid ocean, being killed for oil. Iâ€™ve also been the whaler, travelling to far of seas, leaving family behind, in search of whales. Iâ€™ve been the deer running from the leopard, in Masai Mara. Iâ€™ve also been the leopard, hunting that same deer.</p>

<p>Within my dreams, I travel to the farthest destinations, within a blink of my eyes and in a moment of my thought.</p>

<p>These are the precise reasons why I hang a dream catcher near to where I sleep. Who knows, one day I might get the chance to travel to the land of my dreamsâ€¦</p>
