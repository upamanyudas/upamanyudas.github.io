In 2019, a team of New Zealand zoologists, searching for a common insect, made an incredible discovery.

Professor Jon Waters & PhD student Brodi Foster from the University of Otago ventured into the Maungatua Range near Dunedin in search of a widespread species of stonefly when he stumbled upon a new species. This species of wingless stonefly has been sitting undiscovered in the mountains for 2 million years.

This short film outlines the discovery.
