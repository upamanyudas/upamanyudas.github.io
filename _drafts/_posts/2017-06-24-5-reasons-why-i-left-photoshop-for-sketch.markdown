I've been working in Adobe Photoshop  for almost the past 8 years as a designer. And since I've started to design User Interfaces, all I’ve ever used is Photoshop for web-based or app projects. Given how fast my workflow had become using Photoshop, I thought there was no way I could move through another program that efficiently.

That’s changed.

The last four UI designs I've worked on (3 apps and a website), I've primarily used Sketch. The times I found my cursor looking for Ps, it was only for what Photoshop was built for — modifying photos.
