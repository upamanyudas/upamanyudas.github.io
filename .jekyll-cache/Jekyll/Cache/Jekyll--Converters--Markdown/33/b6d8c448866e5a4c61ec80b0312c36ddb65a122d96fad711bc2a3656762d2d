<p>This year, during <em>Basanta Utsav</em> I visited my cousins in Shantiniketan. It was a fun time. I got to experience and photograph one of the most lively celebrations of the festival <em>Holi</em>.</p>

<p>The first day of the trip started with attending the rehearsals of the programme, <em>Chitrangada</em>.</p>

<p>The second day was that of <em>Basanta Bandana</em>, the salutation of spring. On this day, <em>Viswa Bharati</em> presented, an Esraj choir and <em>Basanta Raas</em>. Both were magnificent to watch</p>

<p>And the third and the final day was of <em>Basanta Utsav</em>. In the morning was a programme, which I wasnâ€™t allowed to shoot, and in the evening was <em>Chitrangada</em>.</p>
