<p>Shubho Bijoya.
Every year, during the Pujo, which is in fact Eastern India’s biggest festival, we Bengali’s find happiness in everything. And often forcibly.
During these days, we forget everything to enjoy, enjoy and enjoy.
We let go Maa Durga with one singular hope, #AascheBochorAabarHobe.</p>
