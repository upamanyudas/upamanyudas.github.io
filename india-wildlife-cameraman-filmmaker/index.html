<i>This film was made during my Master's programme at the University of Otago. In the mountains of South Island of New Zealand, lives a parrot smarter than any other. Surviving in one of the toughest environments of the Southern Alps, the Kea is a hustler. Through millions of years of evolution, they have developed unique skills to survive in this unforgiving environment. This film tries to explore Kea's intellect through the research of Amalia Bastos & Lydia McLean.</i>
