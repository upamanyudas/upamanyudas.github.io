Today, in the year 1921, a great man was born. I still remember, the first film I ever watched in my life, was Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne. Since then I've watched many films by many great directors, but none were like him.

Like everyone else I wish I'd met this man. He's my biggest inspiration, and there shall never be another Satyajit Ray.

Happy Birthday.
