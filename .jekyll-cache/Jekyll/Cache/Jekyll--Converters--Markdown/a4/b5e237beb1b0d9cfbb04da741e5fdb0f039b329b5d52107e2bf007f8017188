I"°<p>There are quite a few traditions around India hold enough strength to amaze you. This curious tradition that goes on around in a small town in Maharashtra, would surely capture your imagination. The town is known as Jejuri and it is situated at about a 50km drive from Pune. I first heard the name Jejuri while sifting through the newspaper one day, where I found a small article on the curious tradition that goes on there.</p>
