I"â<p>In the mountains to South of New Zealand, lives a parrot smarter than any other. Surviving in one of the toughest environments of the Southern Alps, the Kea is a hustler. Through millions of years of evolution, they have developed unique skills to survive in this unforgiving environment.</p>

<p>Research from the University of Auckland, suggests that the Kea can perform tasks which was previously thought only doable by apes. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14695-1" target="_blank">newest paper on their intellect</a>, also suggests that the Keaâ€™s intelligence is flexible and domain-general.</p>

<p>When I first came across Amaliaâ€™s research, I was very intrigued by the extent of Kea intelligenge. I was interested to make a film exploring the evolution of their minds, and how they compare with our closest ancestors, the great apes. In this film I have tried to explore the Keaâ€™s intellect through the research of Amalia Bastos &amp; Lydia McLean.</p>
