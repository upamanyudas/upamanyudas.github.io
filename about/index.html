            <p>Hello, I’m Upamanyu! I am currenly working as a freelance designer. I have to travel between Mumbai &amp; Kolkata but mostly live in Mumbai, India.</p>
            <p>I co-own a design firm that I had bery dearly named, <a href="http://studio.upamanyu.in">Cloudstudio</a> which I started in 2008.</p>
            <p>I am a illustrator by heart, but I also take immense interest in product development, electronics and code development. PHP is my favourite language when in Web Development. C++ is my all-time favorite, but now I’m shifting more towards <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a>. I prefer working on the backend.</p>
            <p>I am currently available freelance design &amp; development projects and always ready to back interesting ideas.</p>
            <p>If you want to know about the Setup I use head on to <a href="/setup">/setup</a>.</p>
            <p>There is a list of personal &amp; commercial projectn I worked with  <a href="/projects">/projects</a>.</p>
            <p>I push most of my code to <a href="http://github.com/upamanyudas">GitHub</a>.</p>
            <p>My little spare time is spent running open-source projects:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><a href="http://upass.in/2">uPass</a>, a smart password manager for smart people</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I was born in Kolkata, India, I grew up there. Bengali is my mother tongue but I do have full professional proficiency in English. I speak, read, and understand conversational Hindi.</p>
            <p><strong>Pronunciation</strong> : Pronuncing my name can be a little difficult. The approximate phonetic is /uːpɔːmʌnjuː daːʃ/.</p>
            <p><em>Upamanyu</em> is a sequence of:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>U as in coo without the initial c</li>
            <li>pa as in paw</li>
            <li>man as in munch without the the final ch</li>
            <li>u as in you in totality</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Das</em> is like pass, if you replace the pa with D</p>
            <p>Though I am not much of a athelete nor am I very sporty (which you will know at once when you meet me), but I do enjoy the one sport, that seems to give me a immense peace of mind. Swimming.</p>
            <p>I read &amp; follow <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">HackerNews</a>.</p>
            <p>The only sports event I am interested in watching, is the <a href="http://www.olympic.org/">Olympics</a>.</p>
            <p>I can be stalked at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001505433242">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/cloudstudio">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://instagram.com/cloudstudio">Instagram</a>.</p>
