<p>Gods play a huge role in the lives of us hindus. This is a breif effort to bring the almightys and the gods in a minimalistic form. The project is also available on <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/15940579/Hindu-Gods" target="_blank">Behance</a></p>

	<h6>Brahma (ब्रह्मा)</h6>
	A single day in Brahma’s life lasts more than four million years. He is the creator of the world and all the living things upon it. He is the first one in the cycle of the holy-trinity and is responsible for creation of life. Sometimes he rides a magical goose or swan endowed with the ability to tell good from bad. Unlike other Gods, Brahma carries no weapon, though he does keep a carafe of water with him at all times, and not just to quench his thirst — it contains the source of life. Brahma is also the keeper of the holy Vedas. His four faces represent the four Vedas. In hindu symbology he is represented by a ‘circle’, symbolising the unending cycle of life.

	<h6>Vishnu (विष्णु)</h6>
	It is said that opposite forces are always battling for the control of the world. Vishnu’s role in the cycle of the holy-trinity is that of the invincible protector. As the legend goes, when the world did not exist, he was in an dreamless slumber on a serpent bed which was on the ocean of milk. As soon as he opened his eyes he realised himself and the world around him, and henceforth creation begun. He has four hands holding the Shankha (Conch Shell), Chakra (Discus), Gada (Mace) & Padma (Lotus). His mount is an half-eagle half-human creature named Garuda, who is an fear to the snakes.

	<h6>Maheshwar (महेश्वर)</h6>
	Maheshwar or Shiva is one of the oldest gods in India and plays many roles. He is a devout meditator and yogi, a cosmic dancer setting the rhythms of the universe & a benevolent protector and a husband.He is the third and the last one in the cycle of holy-trinity. He has the role of a destructor. When Dharma & Adharma are imbalanced in this world he destructs the world and the cycle of creation begins again. He is generally seen smoking weed in the premises of any cemetery, though his original abode is at Mount Kailash, where he rests along with his family. He is seen carrying a trident at all times along with a Damaru (Small Drum).

	<h6>Krishna (कृष्ण)</h6>
	The eighth incarnation of Vishnu is Krishna. His name means both “the dark one” and “all-attractive one”. He is considered to be one of the most important and widely worshipped gods in India. He took birth in a jail cell to kill the unjust king Kansa, who was also his maternal uncle. But due to circumstances he had to transferred to a cowherd’s home. He grew up as a cowherd herding cows with the melodious tune of his flute, and hence is called Go-pal (Cow-herd). In his childhood he along with his friends would steal butter. These acts gave him the name of Makhan-chor (Butter-thief). As Krishna grew older, he started stealing the hearts of women as well. But the woman most important to him was Radha. The love between Radha and Krishna developed the bhakti-yuga, which came to be known as the ‘hare krishna’ movement.

	<h6>Hanuman (हनुमान)</h6>
	Hanuman is the eleventh and the most popular of the lesser known incarnations of Lord Shiva (Maheshwar). He has the head of a monkey and an muscular human body. He is the son of Vayu (Wind god) and often referred to as Pavan-putra (Wind’s-son). He is considered the most devout disciple of Lord Ram, and remains always by his side. When he was sent to bring the elixir-herbs from a mountain to save Laxman’s life on the battlefield, unable to identify the herbs, he brought back the whole mountain. After Ravana kidnapped Sita, he was sent as Ram’s envoy, and was given a ring by Ram to convince Sita that he was truly Ram’s messenger. With a formidable leap he crossed the seas and reached Lanka, where Sita was being held captive. In addition to being strong, clever & witty, he was also a loyal friend. When was the last time someone brought you a mountain?

<p>
	<h6>Indra (इंद्र)</h6>
	Indra, also known as Śakra in the Vedas, is the god of war and storms. In ancient times Indra reigned supreme because he controlled the great celestial weapon — the vajra (thunder). Armed with his power drink, soma, and the mighty vajra, Indra would ride into battles on the great white elephant, Airavata, whose mighty steps shook the ground and echoed like thunder. Indra’s most powerful exploit was a dragon named Vritra, who drank all the world’s water. He defeated the dragon and brought back water in the draught stricken land. Indra became a hero and was crowned the king go all gods residing at swarga. But over the time he lost his importance, and was given a minor role of a weather god over the time.

<p>
	<h6>Yamraj (यमराज)</h6>
	Yamraj is the god of judgement and death. Knowing everyones deeds, he imparts justice according to their history and then escorts their soul to their final justice in hell or heaven. When a person dies, the yamduts (Yamraj’s sentries) escort the dead persons soul over the river vaitarini to Yamraj’s court where the final judgement is made. He also has a book-keeper named Chitragupta who keeps track of a person deeds. Yamraj holds a mace with spikes which symbolises the weapon of punishment. In some legends it is said that Yamraj didn't begin as a god, he earned the title by being the first human to die and thus the first one to learn about the past of the dead. In others he along with dharma is stated as a form of Vishnu. Due to the grief of his twin sister Yami, the gods created night as a symbol of the passage of time, to bring an end to Yami’s grief.
