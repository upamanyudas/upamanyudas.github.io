We have been debating too long about technology being a boon or a curse. Well according to me (and this is my strictly personal opinion) it is a bigger curse than it is a boon.

It has and is slowly taking humanity to a more anti-social level. It is making us lesser and lesser connected to each other by souls.

My analysis is that, technology was great, till a certain extent. But then it got out of bounds, breaking the leash. The methods of delivery of information started becoming more and more dangerous.

Today it has reach an extent, where we cannot survive without technology. I find this notion frightening.

In frame are my cousins, Srijit (brother) & Srija (sister).
