Dhuno Pora, is a tradition that is followed during the Jagadhatri Puja in Krishnanagar. Percisely at two _Baroyari_ Pujas - _Malopara_ & _Chashapara_. Though it is even followed at some _Bonedi Bari_ s in Kolkata, it is hard to beat the intensity with which the flames roll up in _Malopara_.

Every year, few women vow before the godess of _Malopara_ also known as _Ma Jaleshwari_, and this is the way the vow is fulfilled.

The vowed woman sits in front of the idol, legs folded and hands rested on the knees. Then she is draped with pieces of dripping wet cotton cloth, from head to toe. Three _malsha_ s are placed, one each on the head and the two hands atop lumps of wet mud. The _malsha_ s have a fire burning with the help of jute sticks and solid _dhuno_ (frankincense).

Then comes the toughest part, a man expert in this trade comes forward with a bowl full of finely powdered _dhuno_ (frankincense). They take a handfull of the powder and throw some in to ingnite the flame a little more. _Dhuno_ being a highly inflamable substance widens the fire quickly, and it is then when he throws the rest of the powder towards the sky, which produces an immense flame seen in the pictures.

Krishnanagar being the location of my ancestral home, and my grandmother belonging to _Malopara_, I had the chance of an exclusive experience. It's indescribable how I felt the heat of the flames, being quite near to the proceedings. The dusted _dhuno_ spraying all over (even on my camera & lens).

This is an experience that I wanted to experience for the past 7 years, but could not do so. This year, I was determined to vist my uncles at Krishnanagar, and experience _Dhuno Pora_ for myself. I must say this experience is one of its kind.
