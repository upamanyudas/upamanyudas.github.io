I"Æ<p>Five years back, a visit to Alipore Zoo on a rainy afternoon, yielded some <a href="https://upamanyu.in/works/2015/zoo-portraits" target="_blank">portraits of the residents</a>. The camera was a new tool for me then, and I was learning to use it to the fullest. That visit sparked the humble beginnings of a new life for me, I became connected with the caueses of wildlife conservation and deciced on a career path that took me towards filmaking.</p>
